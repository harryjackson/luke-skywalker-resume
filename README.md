Luke Skywalker Resume Template

## Generate Resume

To generate the resume I used TeXstudio which was extremely easy to use. The
only change I needed to make was under Preferences--Build--Default Compiler I
changed it from PdfLateX to XeLateX.

## Notes

I added extra sections into this resume that I would not normally put on my own
resume like References, I never give out references until further along the
interview process because I don't like giving out peoples information so
easily, especially people willing to give me a reference.

It's personaly preference what to put on your resume and how to word it.
